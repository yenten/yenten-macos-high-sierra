# Yenten for MacOS High Sierra

## Yenten Core v1.3.1.0-466df44-beta

Hello. This is original **Yenten** repo (https://github.com/conan-equal-newone/yenten) compiled binaries
done on my MacbookPro 2017 \w latest MacOS.
It was little unconventional first time and took some skills to build it, so I decided to share with
community in case if you could or would not compile wallet by yourself.
